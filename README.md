# Mass-Mailer
Mass mailer is a gui based app designed for sending lot of email fast.
It is built off of mailgun's api and requires your own account. Do not use default server and api key because aparently mailgun has banned me and they will not work.

It has 3 dependancys. Sfml for drawing the gui. Boost.Asio for multiple uses including multithreading, parsing json, and more. And finally LibCURL for sending packets.

This is one of my first completed c++ projects as I am not very good at finishing things.

coming soon
